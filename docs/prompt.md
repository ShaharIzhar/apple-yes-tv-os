I want to debloat my Android TV and replace its launcher with a clean Apple TV style home screen.
My TV model is: yes streamer – an Israeli operator (yes pay-TV) Android TV box; Settings shows the model only as "yes". IP <your TV's IP>, wired Ethernet into the box's own port (no USB Ethernet adapter).

IMPORTANT for this device: this is a yes operator box. The yes app, its launcher, and every yes / il.co.yes package, plus any DRM, tuner, TV input, CA/conditional-access and operator update services, are what play my live channels, recordings and VOD – never disable them, and ask me if a package might belong to that chain. Leave the yes launcher ENABLED: only make the new launcher Home with set-home-activity, reboot once, and confirm Home, ADB and live yes channels all still work. If the box refuses sideloaded APKs or HOME launchers, do the debloat half only, tell me plainly, and stop.

Work on the real device, step by step, and verify everything you
do with screenshots pulled from the TV. Ask me before anything that depends on my preferences.
Where these steps name a file under `tools/`, `docs/` or `examples/` that is not in your working
folder, you are running without this repo: clone it first with
`git clone https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv` and work from there, so `tools/disable.sh` and the
rest keep their safety checks, rather than stopping or writing your own.

Connect
- Find the TV on my network (hostname, ARP table, or ask me for the IP) and connect over ADB on port 5555.
  If the TV is in another home, I'll give you its Tailscale address instead (docs/REMOTE.md): use that,
  don't scan my local network.
- If the stock adb binary fails with "No route to host" on macOS even though the port is open, that is
  macOS Local Network privacy blocking adb. Don't debug it: use the Python `adb-shell` package in a venv
  as the ADB client instead. If its file push hangs on larger files, transfer files as base64 chunks
  through the shell and verify the md5.
- If your own commands can't reach the TV at all while it answers from an ordinary terminal (a sandbox that
  blocks the local network), ask me to run `tools/relay.py <tv ip>` in a terminal and leave it running, then
  use `TV_HOST=127.0.0.1 TV_PORT=15555` (`tools/relay.md`).
- If port 5555 stays closed, the TV may only offer Wireless debugging (Google TV sets often do): look for
  `_adb-tls-connect._tcp` with `dns-sd -B` or `adb mdns services`, ask me for the code and port under
  Developer options > Wireless debugging > Pair device with pairing code, then `adb pair`, `adb connect`
  and `adb tcpip 5555`. Android switches Wireless debugging off whenever Wi-Fi drops.
  Some firmware runs network ADB on another fixed port instead (a projector used 5877): if 5555 refuses and
  nothing advertises Wireless debugging, scan the TV's own TCP ports and try each open one with `TV_PORT`.
- If the TV turns out not to be Android TV / Google TV (no ADB port at all, or it identifies as Tizen,
  webOS, Roku OS, VIDAA or SmartCast), stop and tell me to use https://cleanyour.tv/not-android, which
  turns off the tracking with the remote. Nothing in this repo applies to it.
- Tell me when the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt will appear on the TV so I can accept it.
- If `adb install` hangs on Android 14 it is waiting for an on-screen confirmation; push the APK and run
  `pm install -r` over the shell instead.

Back up first
- Save the full package list, disabled-package list, getprop output and all settings to a backup folder
  before changing anything, and write a restore script that re-enables everything you disable.
- Ask me what is plugged into the TV's USB ports, and ask separately whether the TV's network comes
  through a USB Ethernet adapter: "nothing plugged in" can be true while the network itself is on that
  port. Some devices cut their power while USB debugging is on, so warn me, and remind me to switch
  debugging off once you're done. On a set that reaches the network over USB Ethernet, check before you
  change anything: `dumpsys usb | grep host_connected` (`host_connected=false` means the adapter is
  already gone) and `dumpsys connectivity | grep -o 'Transports: [A-Z]*'` (`WIFI` on a TV I call wired
  means the box fell back, and ADB is running over Wi-Fi). Finish the whole job in one sitting, not
  two: there the port only returns with USB debugging off, and that closes port 5555 as well. Prefer
  Wireless debugging if the TV has it.
- When you finish, close network ADB instead of leaving it open: switch USB debugging and
  Network/ADB debugging off on the TV, revoke the USB debugging authorisations, reboot, and check
  with `tools/adb-closed.py <tv ip>` that the port refuses the connection. If the TV's network came
  over a USB Ethernet adapter, unplug and replug the adapter once debugging is off - the port comes
  back with it - and have me confirm the TV is on Ethernet again, not Wi-Fi. Don't trust `nc` on macOS:
  Local Network privacy can block it too, and its "No route to host" proves nothing; only "Connection
  refused" does. Port 5555 is plaintext, and on firmware with `ro.adb.secure=0` any device on the LAN
  can get a shell.

Debloat
- List installed packages and sort them into: manufacturer telemetry/analytics, manufacturer content
  and ad services (PatchWall, recommendation rows, content providers), background services I probably
  don't need (share/cast duplicates, cleaners), preloaded apps, and streaming apps.
- Disable the first categories with `pm disable-user --user 0`, never uninstall system packages.
- Never disable what the TV needs to work: the TV app and input services that play HDMI and the
  tuner, the input/source menu, remote control and Bluetooth pairing services, the on-screen
  keyboard, Google Play Store and Play Services. Manufacturer package names often don't say what a
  package does: check its activities and services with `dumpsys package` first, and ask me if it's
  still unclear.
- Never disable Android's own core packages, or the TV may not boot again: the permission controller,
  the package installer, ext services and ext shared, module metadata (each as `com.android.*` or
  `com.google.android.*`), `com.google.android.overlay.modules*`, `com.android.providers.*` (calendar,
  contacts, user dictionary and blocked numbers aside), `com.android.systemui`, `com.android.shell`,
  `com.android.phone`, `com.android.settings`, `com.android.tv.settings` and `android`. An original Mi TV
  Stick never booted again after a list took the first six
  ([#884](https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv/issues/884)); `tools/disable.sh` refuses such a list.
- Before touching streaming apps, voice assistant, Chromecast, Miracast or the update service, ask me
  which ones I use with a checklist question and disable only what I don't tick.
- Run `pm` commands one per shell call, chained commands may silently stop after the first.
- If `pm disable-user` is refused for every package, stop and tell me: some firmware (Fire OS 5 on a
  Fire TV Box, for one) refuses `pm disable-user` with a `SecurityException`, `pm uninstall --user 0`
  with `DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR`, and `pm hide` reports success while changing nothing. Check
  with `pm list packages -d` instead of the exit code, and don't burn the session retrying - there is
  nothing to debloat on such a set, so we fall back to its own privacy toggles and DNS blocking
  (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- Don't launch a package whose name says factory, production, AT or fac menu (`com.cvte.tv.hkcfac`,
  `com.cvte.tv.fac.menu`, `com.at.factory.*`, `mediatek.factorymenu.ui` and the like) to see what it does, even read-only:
  on Haier/CVTE boards opening one flips a factory-mode flag that kills the Input key and CEC, and
  makes the next boot disable Play services, Netflix and Chromecast - which the shell then cannot
  re-enable. `dumpsys package <name>` tells you what a package is without starting it, and
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` has the way out if one has been opened.
- Disable in small batches and screenshot between them: a batch can take something load-bearing with
  it and you cannot tell which.
- After the last batch, wait about 15 seconds before rebooting - Android writes package state to
  disk about ten seconds after a change (`WRITE_SETTINGS_DELAY`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`), so a
  reboot sent straight after the batch boots with the old state and what came back reads as
  firmware re-enabling packages it never re-enabled. `adb shell sync` first is fine too. Then reboot
  once and compare `pm list packages -d` with what you disabled: some
  firmware re-enables packages at every boot from its own list (TCL Android 9 does this for its user
  center). Note those in the list header instead of disabling them again after each boot. If
  setupwraith or the stock launcher came back and Home is black, check `logcat | grep
  RecoveryActivity` and re-enable the stock launcher before anything else
  (`docs/devices/acer-r4g.md`).
- Offer me ad-blocking DNS as an optional extra: on Android 9 and newer, Private DNS set to an
  ad-blocking resolver (`settings put global private_dns_specifier dns.adguard-dns.com`, then
  `settings put global private_dns_mode hostname`). Tell me it doesn't block YouTube ads, check an app
  still plays afterwards, and note the undo (`private_dns_mode opportunistic`) in the README.
  Ask me first whether my router already filters or routes traffic by domain through its own DNS
  (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, a VPN with domain lists, a fake-IP proxy): Private DNS goes around it, so those
  rules stop applying to the TV, and blocking on the router is the better choice there.

Launcher
- Check that the TV accepts APKs before building anything. Some China-market sets answer every
  sideload with `INSTALL_FAILED_VERIFICATION_FAILURE` — `adb install`, `pm install`, a hand-started
  installer and even the manufacturer's own APKs all fail — and others refuse any package that
  declares `android.intent.category.HOME` unless it carries the manufacturer's signature. If you
  hit either, do the debloat half, say plainly that the launcher half is impossible here, and stop
  retrying installs. The matching `examples/` header says which case your TV is.
- Check the TV's SDK level before promising the launcher, too: `tools/tv.py 'getprop
  ro.build.version.sdk'` against `grep minSdk launcher/app/build.gradle` (26 = Android 8.0). A set
  below it answers `INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK`; lowering `minSdk` is a source change you would then
  maintain yourself, and an APK rebuilt elsewhere is nothing this repo can verify. On those sets offer
  the debloat half and say the launcher cannot be installed. With no launcher to hand over to, the
  stock one stays: `cmd package` does not exist before Android 7, so `tools/disable.sh` asks `dumpsys
  activity` for Home there and warns when neither answers - that warning means nothing was checked,
  and a set with no recovery has no way back (#795).
- Don't install a third-party launcher that charges for basics like wallpapers. Build a small native
  Android TV launcher instead (Java, AndroidX RecyclerView, minSdk matching the TV, debug build is fine),
  install it over ADB, set it as the default home and disable the stock launcher. If several apps claim
  the HOME intent, list them with `cmd package query-activities -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c
  android.intent.category.HOME` and set the default with `cmd package set-home-activity`. Those two
  commands can both name your launcher while Home still opens something else: on some Google TV builds
  `set-home-activity` prints `Success` and changes nothing, and setupwraith's `.RecoveryActivity`
  keeps the key. Confirm with `dumpsys activity activities | grep mFocusedApp` before telling me the
  takeover worked.
- Before disabling the stock launcher, check which other apps claim HOME: on Google TV the setup wizard
  (`com.google.android.tungsten.setupwraith`) takes over even after the stock launcher is disabled, and
  the matching `examples/` header says what to do. Before disabling setupwraith, run
  `dumpsys wifi | grep -o 'cname=[^ ]*'`: a Wi-Fi network saved during first setup belongs to it, and
  Android deletes that network the moment it is disabled, which takes the TV off Wi-Fi and ADB. If it
  does, ask me to forget the network and re-join it in Settings first.
- On a CVTE board (any `com.cvte.*` package), leave its stock launcher (`com.cvte.tv.launcher.*`) enabled
  unless the `examples/` folder for that exact board disables it: make your launcher Home with
  `set-home-activity`, reboot once, and confirm Home and ADB come back before anything else. Don't enable a
  remote-key helper in the same pass. A JVC LT-43N7115 (`TP.SK706S.PC822`, Android 11) hung on its boot
  animation with ADB gone after both were done before one reboot (#741).
- On Google TV the stock launcher also answers the remote's app buttons (Netflix, YouTube and the like),
  Input and Settings/dashboard buttons, so after disabling it ask me to press each one, and remap any that
  do nothing with the launcher's key services: `input_key_keycodes` and `app_keys` with
  INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1, `settings_key_keycodes` with HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1 (`config.xml` or the theme).
  Enabling either helper can cost more than the buttons it maps: on a TCL G09 build (Google TV 12) ask me
  to hold volume up before and after, because a bound key-filtering service there drops the key repeats -
  a ramping volume becomes one step per press, one helper or both, all or nothing - so say which one I am
  giving up instead of enabling it quietly (`docs/devices/tcl-55p71b-g09-key-repeat.md` has the bisect and
  the three ways out). On other sets this was not measured; if holding a button stops repeating once a
  helper is on, it is the same trade and not a broken remote.
  A button the TV logs as `KEY_UNKNOWN` or `KEY_PROGRAM` cannot be matched by keycode, since every
  unmapped button shares it: read the scancode with `getevent -lt` and use `settings_key_scancodes`,
  which only `config.xml` carries (a theme can set keycodes, not scancodes).
- After the first reboot with the new Home, check what the TV opens at power-on
  (`logcat -b events -d | grep wm_set_resumed_activity`). If the firmware puts the Live TV app on screen by
  itself, ask me which I want to land on, Home or Live TV: Home is `power_on_home` with HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1,
  Live TV is `boot_to_live_tv` (`config.xml` or the theme). Never set both.
- On Android 11 and newer the launcher must declare `<queries>` for `android.intent.category.LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`,
  or package visibility silently hides every app and the grid comes up empty; target a recent SDK, some
  Google TV 14 sets refuse older targets at install.
- If you write the launcher yourself, make its theme explicitly opaque (`windowIsTranslucent`,
  `windowIsFloating` and `windowSwipeToDismiss` false): on some firmware `Theme.DeviceDefault` comes out
  translucent, the TV app keeps running under Home, and after an HDMI input the picture stays on screen.
- Ask how many dock slots I want (4, 5, 6 or 7), which apps, and their order; keep four if I have no
  preference. The reference launcher already supports this: use `columns` and `dock_apps` in
  `launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml` or a theme's `config.json`, without adding a new layout.
- Design, Apple TV 4K style: pitch black background; a dock row at the bottom of the screen inside a
  slightly lighter rounded band holding the apps I pick; the rest of the apps in a grid with the same
  number of columns below that scrolls up when I press Down; one translucent "glass" highlight
  that springs from tile to tile instead of per-tile borders; the focused tile scales up slightly and
  shows its name underneath; above the dock, the focused dock app's name in large light type with an
  ambient glow in a colour sampled from its banner; frosted pill buttons top right for Inputs, Wi-Fi
  (showing the network name) and Settings; a greeting, a large thin clock and the date top left in a
  downloaded open-licence typeface such as Outfit. Inputs opens a compact glass dropdown under the pill
  listing the HDMI ports, AV and Live TV, switching via the TV input framework.
- My additions to the design (these override "pitch black background" above):
  - Real app logos: every tile shows the app's own banner from the system (`ActivityInfo.loadBanner`,
    falling back to the app icon centred on a tile tinted from the icon's dominant colour). Never draw
    placeholder letters when the app ships a banner. Keep the yes app's own logo as its tile.
  - A lively but elegant wallpaper instead of plain black, in the spirit of Apple TV's Aerials (but never
    Apple's own footage or stills): a set of 6 high-end, dark, high-resolution photos - 2 of Earth from
    orbit (NASA/ISS public-domain imagery, e.g. city lights at night or the horizon at sunrise), 2 drone
    shots of cities at night (Dubai/Hong Kong/Tel Aviv style skylines), and 2 dramatic aerial landscapes
    (Greenland ice, desert dunes, a coastline at dusk) - under a free licence (NASA public domain,
    Unsplash/Pexels), and record each photo's source and licence in the README, bundled in the APK as 1920x1080 JPEGs under ~400 KB each, so
    nothing is fetched at runtime. Slowly cross-fade to the next one every ~10 minutes, and only while
    Home is visible. Add a soft dark scrim (stronger at the bottom behind the dock and at top-left
    behind the clock) so text and tiles stay crisp. Show me the chosen photos as screenshots before
    finalising, and make the set, interval and scrim strength easy to change in config.xml.
  - Still respect the memory limit: decode wallpapers at screen size with inSampleSize, keep at most
    two in memory during a fade, no blur, no video.
- Top Shelf (Apple TV style, my main design goal - see the reference: key art fills the upper two thirds,
  the dock band overlays its lower edge, then the grid below):
  - When a dock app is focused, the background changes to art for a show from that app (Netflix ->
    e.g. Breaking Bad): the show's character art as a transparent PNG cutout on the right, standing over
    a dark, softly vignetted backdrop of that show, with the show's clear logo (transparent title art)
    top left, under the clock. Cross-fade (~400 ms) when focus moves; fall back to the aerial wallpapers
    when the app has no title or art isn't available (Settings, Inputs, apps with no shows).
  - Which show per app, in this order: (1) the app's own Watch Next / Continue Watching rows from
    TvContract (try READ_EPG_DATA granted over ADB; if the provider only returns the launcher's own rows
    or the app doesn't publish any, say so and move on); (2) a per-app list I can edit in config.xml
    (`top_shelf_titles`, e.g. netflix=Breaking Bad|Stranger Things), rotating through the list;
    (3) otherwise a title currently popular on that service in Israel from TMDB (watch providers, region IL).
  - Art: show lookup and backdrop from TMDB, transparent character art and clear logos from fanart.tv
    (`characterart`, `hdclearlogo`), backdrop-only when no character art exists. Both need free API keys:
    ask me for them, keep them in a local, git-ignored properties file, never commit them.
  - Network is allowed only on focus change, never polling: cache images on disk (max ~50 MB, LRU),
    prefetch art for the dock apps once a day, decode at screen size, keep at most 2 large bitmaps in memory.
  - Before finishing, show me screenshots of the Top Shelf for each dock app.
- Make D-pad navigation deterministic: Up/Down move exactly one row, Up from the dock goes to the top
  bar, the ends of the top bar don't fall through to tiles. Remember the last focused tile.
- Keep it light: the TV has about 1 GB of RAM. No blur, no video, no network polling (Top Shelf art is fetched on focus change and cached, as above).

Verify
- After each change, inject remote key presses over ADB, take a screenshot from the TV and look at it:
  `tools/tv.py --screenshot shots/01-after.png DPAD_RIGHT` presses the key, then captures on the TV and
  pulls the PNG (leave the keys off to capture what is already on screen).
  Fix what you see before moving on.
- Live TV, HDMI and some streaming apps (Netflix) give empty screenshots (0 bytes); that is the TV, not a
  broken debloat, and `--screenshot` exits 1 with that message. Check
  `dumpsys activity activities | grep -i ResumedActivity` instead (some builds print no `topResumedActivity`
  line but do print `mResumedActivity`; see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- If screenshots keep showing an app you already left, byte for byte, `screencap` is returning its last
  frame: confirm `mCurrentFocus` in `dumpsys window`, force-stop that app and capture again.
- If the screen looks enlarged and clipped after an install or a reboot, check the display overrides
  before editing the launcher grid: `wm size` and `wm density` show a physical value next to an
  override, and an override left over from an old resolution experiment, or a density that comes back
  wrong on some MediaTek Sony firmware, is not a launcher bug. An empty
  `settings get secure display_density_forced` is a normal default, not damage - read all three
  values first and put them back if you undo (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- If a remote button relies on an accessibility helper, check that the service is enabled and bound
  for the current user, then ask me to press the real button; an injected key is not proof (see
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- When done, give me a restore script, a build-and-install script, and a README that explains how to
  re-enable any app and how to change the dock order or the wallpaper.

API keys: they are in the `TMDB_API_KEY` and `FANART_API_KEY` environment variables, which the build reads. Never print the keys in chat or write them to any file in the repo.
